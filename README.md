# 🍸 Cocktail Builder 

### 🍹 Build and discover drinks you love

Welcome to Cocktail Builder, a full-stack MERN application for creating and discovering custom cocktail recipes. Users can sign up, log in, and build their own drink creations—or explore a list of random cocktails for inspiration!

Our team wanted to build a creative, personalized app that lets users explore and document cocktail recipes. We collaborated on both the frontend and backend.
